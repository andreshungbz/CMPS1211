abstract = {In the field of bioelectronics, the demand for biocompatible, stable, and electroactive materials for functional biological interfaces, sensors, and stimulators, is drastically increasing. Conductive polymers (CPs) are synthetic materials, which are gaining increasing interest mainly due to their outstanding electrical, chemical, mechanical, and optical properties. Since its discovery in the late 1980s, the CP Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) has become extremely attractive, being considered as one of the most capable organic electrode materials for several bioelectronic applications in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Main examples refer to thin, flexible films, electrodes, hydrogels, scaffolds, and biosensors. Within this context, the authors contend that PEDOT:PSS properties should be customized to encompass: i) biocompatibility, ii) conductivity, iii) stability in wet environment, iv) adhesion to the substrate, and, when necessary, v) (bio-)degradability. However, consolidating all these properties into a single functional solution is not always straightforward. Therefore, the objective of this review paper is to present various methods for acquiring and improving PEDOT:PSS properties, with the primary focus on ensuring its biocompatibility, and simultaneously addressing the other functional features. The last section highlights a collection of designated studies, with a particular emphasis on PEDOT:PSS/carbon filler composites due to their exceptional characteristics.}
