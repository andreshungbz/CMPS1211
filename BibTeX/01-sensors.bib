ABSTRACT = {Sensors enable the detection of physiological indicators and pathological markers to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term monitoring of diseases, in addition to playing an essential role in the observation and evaluation of physiological activities. The development of modern medical activities cannot be separated from the precise detection, reliable acquisition, and intelligent analysis of human body information. Therefore, sensors have become the core of new-generation health technologies along with the Internet of Things (IoTs) and artificial intelligence (AI). Previous research on the sensing of human information has conferred many superior properties on sensors, of which biocompatibility is one of the most important. Recently, biocompatible biosensors have developed rapidly to provide the possibility for the long-term and in-situ monitoring of physiological information. In this review, we summarize the ideal features and engineering realization strategies of three different types of biocompatible biosensors, including wearable, ingestible, and implantable sensors from the level of sensor designing and application. Additionally, the detection targets of the biosensors are further divided into vital life parameters (e.g., body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate), biochemical indicators, as well as physical and physiological parameters based on the clinical needs. In this review, starting from the emerging concept of next-generation diagnostics and healthcare technologies, we discuss how biocompatible sensors revolutionize the state-of-art healthcare system unprecedentedly, as well as the challenges and opportunities faced in the future development of biocompatible health sensors.},
